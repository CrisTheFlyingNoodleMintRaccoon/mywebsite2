                I'm 25 years old, I'm from the land of Mate 🧉, Messi ⚽ and up until 2025 the Pope 🇻🇦 (in case you
                still can't
                guess it's Argentina 🇦🇷!).
                <div id="details1">I am a physics student, with dreams of becoming a world renown physicist and making
                    huge
                    contributions to humanity's knowledge, and working at CERN, in Switzerland.</div>
                <div id="details1">When I'm not studying and plotting world domination, I'm yelling at randoms in
                    Counter-Strike 2,
                    sweating my ass of in Marvel Rivals, chilling in Age of Empires 2:DE, or hanging out with friends!

                <div id="details1">I am a furry (wowzers! such a shock!), and I currently have 2 fursonas.</div>
                <div id="details1">Cris a mint raccoon 🦝, very curious 🔍, loves science 🧪 and very shy, he shares my
                    same nickname IRL and
                    he was my first fursona, so he holds a dear place in my heart.</div>
                <div id="details1">And Mirek 🐉, an eastern dragon, who's a lot more outgoing ✨, sometimes a bit over
                    the top 😅, and well
                    let's say he's always down to please ;3.</div>
                <div id="details1">Besides that, I've worked as web developer for a couple months before (hence this
                    website lol),
                    I've played in chess tournaments as a kid, and I have also dabbled in music production in my teen
                    days.</div>
                <div id="details1">If you'd like to know more don't hesitate to ask! I may take a while to answer, but I
